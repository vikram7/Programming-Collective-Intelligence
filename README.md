Command-line based movie recommendation app based on Toby Segaran's Programming Collective Intelligence. Movie recommendations are based on a collaborative filtering algorithm (Pearson similarity). Written in Ruby. Movie recommendations sourced from MovieLens.

To-do:
- sanitize user input (specifically when movie string title isn't in the database)
- refactor algorithm code
- optimize for time
- current algorithm is similar people recommendations, but i'd like to add similar product recommendations
